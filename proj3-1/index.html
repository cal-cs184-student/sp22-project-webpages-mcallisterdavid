	<h3 id="task-1">Task 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>
	<p>At each step, the de Casteljau algorithm linearly interpolates N-1 points from N control points. This can be performed recursively to compute individual points along the curve that those points define. A parameter <em>t</em> controls how far along the curve between the control points we would like to evaluate. In this way, the curve becomes a function parametrized by <em>t</em>.</p>

	<h3 id="task-2">Task 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
	<ul>
	</ul>
	<p>de Casteljau's algorithm extends to 3D by switching from <em>n</em> control points to <em>n</em> sets of <em>n</em> control points. Each row of these points is evaluated as in the 2D curve case with parameter <em>u</em>. This produces a single set of control points that can then be evaluated with the same process and a parameter <em>v</em>. Thus, the control points fully define a 3D curve that can be evaluated along its surface by adjusting the <em>u</em> and <em>v</em> parameters.</p>

	<h2 id="task-3">Task 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h2>
	<p>We implemented the area-weighted vertex normals by iterating all the adjacent faces around a given vertex and summing their normals. This is then normalized by dividing by the vertex's degree. Interpolating these normals across the surface produces <em>by-pixel</em> shading.</p>

	<h2 id="task-4">Task 4: Edge Flip</h2>
	<p>We implemented edge flips by carefully diagramming a set of two triangles with a shared edge before and after the flip. This was the hardest section in terms of debugging. There were multiple mesh elements that we didn't think to update. For example, we neglected to update the faces' halfedge pointers. We also made the mistake of interpreting a halfedge's vertex as the vertex it points to rather than the vertex it originates from. This caused errors across the geometry that were hard to debug and that we didn't fully fix until they were causing problems in loop subdivision.</p>

	<em>../dae/cube/input.dae</em> subdivided a few iterations, showing position mis-assignments caused by edge flip vertex pointer bugs.</p>
	<h2 id="task-5">Task 5: Edge Split</h2>
	<p>We implemented edge splitting in a very similar way to edge flipping. We actually copied all the code that isolates each mesh element (faces, vertices, half-edges, etc) and then expanded on it. We constructed three new edges, marked two as <em>isNew</em>, and constructed a new vertex. The code actually ran first try! The only thing we were missing was assigning the vertex's position, which we did by averaging the two edge-adjacent vertices' positions.</p>
	<p>Nearest sampling projects the desired screen coordinate into barycentric triangle coordinates and then into image space. This likely lands between pixels in discrete image space, so it selects the color of the nearest one. Bilinear sampling, on the other hand, combines the color values of the nearest set of 4 pixels via linear combination. The weights for this combination are higher for pixels closer to the projected coordinates.</p>

	<h2 id="task-6">Task 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h2>
	<p>We implemented loop subdivision using the process recommended on the spec. We first calculated the future positions of all current vertices then did the same for future vertices by iterating through all current edges. We then perform 4-1 subdivision, marking the two edges that were not contained in the split edge as new. We did a check on every edge to see if the <em>isNew</em> values of the two adjacent vertices were different. If so, we flipped the edge. At this point, we just had to set the positions of all the vertices from our prior computation and reset the <em>isNew</em> flags.</p>

	<p><em>../dae/torus/input.dae</em> showing mesh output during debugging process.</p>
	<p>We didn't run into too arduous of a debugging process. As shown above, we were experiencing mispositioning on several vertices after subdividing different input geometry. This ended up being the result of misassigned pointers for vertices' half-edge struct members. After many subdivisions, this produced some really interesting geometry.</p>

    <p><em>../dae/cube/input.dae</em> during debugging process after performing many subdivisions.</p>
	<p>Certain meshes behave better than others in response to loop subdivision. The torus input geometry subdivides very nicely into a nice ring geometry.</p>

    <p><em>../dae/torus/input.dae</em> showing smooth mesh output after several subdivisions.</p>
	<p>Input geometry with sharp edges and corners seems to perform worse, with those sharp elements causing asymmetry and strange geometric output.</p>

    <p><em>../dae/cube/input.dae</em> showing cube after several subdivisions.</p>
    <p>The cube's subdivisions demonstrate the asymmetry resulting from subdividing sharp edges and corners. We can improve this by preprocessing a bit. Starting from the input cube, we split every edge that lies flat diagonally across a face of the cube. This leads to symmetry in the initial edge placement and therefore symmetry in the final subdivided geometry.</p>
